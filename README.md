# Japanese Character Automata

This project implements a romaji-to-kana conversion engine based on Push-Down Automata theory.

The system processes input strings in real time and converts them into Hiragana or Katakana.  
It was designed as a reusable Java library and demonstrated through a simple interactive use case.

The focus areas include:
- State transition design
- String parsing
- Regex processing
- Automata-based language handling
